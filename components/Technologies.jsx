            Java is my most experienced language. I've made some major and minor
            projects including my bachelor in 'Shortest Paths' and an app
            'HeavyMetalDK'. The latter was made in Android Studio. This also
            includes making games like 'Minesweeper' and 'Tic-Tac-Toe', which
            can be seen under my projects or in my

            I have picked up React when I began my work at 'Styrelsen for IT og
            LÃ¦ring'. This is our main frontend framework together with
            JavaScript. I'm very confident with the framework, and my JavaScript
            skills are growing each day. I strive keep myself updated with the
            latest trends in React like 'Hooks', 'Router' and so forth.

            Is my second most experienced language. I enjoy using it as I think
            it's concise and simplistic. I've mostly used it in smaller projects
            for data visualization, games or scripting, but also in 'Machine
            Learning' at University.
