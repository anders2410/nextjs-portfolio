                I am 27 years, currently living in Aarhus and have been doing so
                for the past 6 years. In summer 2020, I finished my Bachelor
                Degree in Computer Science. I am currently working as a Frontend
                Developer at Raptor Services, and have been doing so since
                August 2022.

                As a person, I am smiling and enjoying life. I love to travel
                and have been all around the world during my gap years and in my
                summer vacations. Most recently I have been to Iceland, Poland,
                Iran and Japan. My most memorable journeys have taken me all
                over South-East Asia, where diving has become a favourite hobby
                of mine. At home I enjoy spending time with friends, and doing
                sports, mostly floorball, where I play at the local club, Team
                Ã…rhus Floorball. But I also enjoy others sport as discgolf,
                padel tennis and spikeball. I also enjoy watching sports, almost
                anything, but my favourite is football both European and
                American.

                My interest in programming and software started in High
                School/Gymnasium with the subject &apos;Information
                Technologies&apos;, and since then it has evolved and was the
                main reason I picked Computer Science at University. Im very
                fund of technology in general, and I aspire to keep up with the
                latest trends in software. I value development and creative
                solutions with modern technologies and always strive to be
                update-to-date with all the latest technological advances.
                Whenever time permits I like doing courses on Udemy to further
                educate my self and expand my knowledge and skill set.
